    <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
    <p>
      Tennis is a racquet sport played on a rectangular court. Here are some
      basic rules:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The game is usually played between two players (singles) or two pairs
        (doubles).
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoring is based on points (15, 30, 40) with deuce and advantage in case
        of a tie.
      </li>
      <li>
        The court is divided into singles and doubles areas with specific
        boundary lines.
      </li>
      <li>
        Players must serve the ball into the opponent's service box diagonally.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <li>Tennis racket: A tennis racket cannot exceed 73.7 cm in length and 31.7 cm in width.

      <h2>Tennis shots</h2>
      Tennis players use a variety of angles, speed and technique to hit the ball in a certain direction or to deceive their opponents to win a point. 
Some common tennis strokes are as follows:
<h3>Forehand and backhand</h3>

The two most common shots in tennis are the forehand and backhand. 
If a right-handed player extends his right hand to hit the ball from the right side of his body, it is called a forehand.
If the right-handed player brings his right hand across his body to hit a shot from the left side of his body, it is called a backhand.
The inverse applies for left-handed players.


<h3>Drop shot</h3>

When a player reduces the speed of his shot to land the ball just above the net and onto the opposite side, it is called a drop shot.
A drop shot is generally used when the opposing player is standing at the baseline and it becomes difficult for them to recover a drop shot as they have to cover quite a distance.

<h3>Smash</h3>

When a player hits a shot with all their power, generally from over their heads, such that the opposing player is unable to reach the ball, it is known as a smash.

<h3>Slice</h3>

A player hits a slice when they cut the ball with the racket facing the court at a cross angle. 
The slice is generally used to slow down the pace of a rally.

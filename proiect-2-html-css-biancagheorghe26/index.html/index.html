        Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a
        single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each
        (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to
        strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and
        into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to maneuver the
        ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.
        The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a
        point, while the opposite player will.

        While tennis can be enjoyed by players of practically any level of
        skill, top competition is a demanding test of both shot making and
        stamina, rich in stylistic and strategic variety. From its origins as a
        garden-party game for ladies in whalebone corsets and starched
        petticoats and men in long white flannels, it has evolved into a
        physical chess match in which players attack and defend, exploiting
        angles and technical weaknesses with strokes of widely diverse pace and
        spin. Tournaments offer tens of millions of dollars in prize money
        annually.
